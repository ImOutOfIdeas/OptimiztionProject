# Chipotle Bowl Optimization Project

## Overview

This repository contains an optimization project aimed at finding the most energy-efficient Chipotle bowl for OSU students. The goal is to identify the optimal combination of ingredients that maximizes energy intake while maintaining an affordable cost and ensuring nutritional balance.

## Objective

Our objective is to develop an algorithm or model that suggests a combination of ingredients for a Chipotle bowl that:

- Maximizes energy intake.
- Ensures affordability for OSU students.
- Maintains a balanced and healthy nutritional profile.

## Methodology

### Dataset

We've collected extensive data on the nutritional content and costs of various ingredients available at Chipotle.

### Optimization Model

We've implemented an optimization model, leveraging algorithms or methodologies (such as linear programming or heuristics), to:
- Maximize energy intake while considering the cost of ingredients.
- Account for dietary preferences and restrictions of OSU students.
- 
## Results

Upon execution, the program will provide:
- The optimized combination of ingredients.
- The total calories provided by the bowl.

## Credits

This project was created by Jacob Bailey, Jonathan Doyle, and Luke Haymond as part of ISE 3230's final project.
